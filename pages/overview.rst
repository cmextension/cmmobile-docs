Overview
========

CM Mobile is developed by `CMExtension  <http://www.cmext.vn>`_. We needed to give our Joomla! extensions ability to connect with our mobile applications, instead of adding this ability to every extension and have duplicated code in them, we built CM Mobile. With CM Mobile, we will not only integrate it with our current and future extensions, but we will also try to integrate with other third-party Joomla! extensions, we hope this will help end users have more choices in finding a solution to build their mobile applications for their Joomla! website.

CM Mobile is not a component which can help you do everything with some mouse clicks, CM Mobile requires coding to add more features and support more components. If you are not a technical user who knows web programming, then you may need to find a developer to help you add your own ideas to CM Mobile, you can also contact us for support.
